# Decisions

The log of human rulings. Each entry is dated and names the step that applies it. The open decisions are in
`DECISIONS_TO_MAKE.md` (step 5). Once a ruling is made it is recorded here.

---

## R-1 — The markdown corpus is the only authority
*24 Sep 2026 · applied in step 3*

Step 3 checks each LaTeX passage against the **current markdown**, not against prin-rs `FINDINGS.md`.
Where the two genuinely conflict, add a `REVIEW_QUEUE.md` entry and don't choose. Citations to FINDINGS
can stay as notes.

## R-2 — The index doesn't cite the unpushed commit `52caf14` *(closes RQ-1)*
*24 Sep 2026 · applied in step 3*

The index shouldn't cite prin-rs `52caf14`, because it exists only on an unpushed branch. Repoint the
citation to `principia_dd_refinement_policy.md` §0.1, which records the same result.

## R-3 — The two PDFs are retired on the same terms as the LaTeX *(closes RQ-3)*
*24 Sep 2026 · applied in step 3*

`sphere_colour_map_spec.pdf` and `com_projection_mini_spec.pdf` are retired. Port what the markdown
relies on into the file that relies on it:
- colour PDF Eq. 5 → `principia_dd_colouring.md` §3.2
- colour PDF §8 (the shape-sphere component → axis convention) → `principia_dd_integrator.md` §3.7
- the COM-projection mini spec → wherever `sec:com_projection` is ported (integrator contract)

Then repoint the references.

## R-4 — "spec-keyed defaults" means the markdown's tier tables *(closes RQ-5)*
*24 Sep 2026 · applied in step 3*

`principia_dd_telemetry_and_tiers.md` line 398 refers to the markdown's tier tables: telemetry §3.5, the
three-axis `eps` / frame-budget / hard-cap model. Repoint it there. **Don't port** the LaTeX
`sec:quality_tiers`, because it predates the move to `eps`.

## R-5 — The chart constants go to the decision sheet *(closes RQ-2)*
*24 Sep 2026 · applied in step 5*

List them with audit B25. `μ_max` is 5 in the LaTeX and 4 in the IC Inspector notes. `α_min` is 0.05 in
the LaTeX and B25, and 0 in the markdown corpus and the tool.

## R-6 — The event priority order goes to the decision sheet *(closes RQ-4)*
*24 Sep 2026 · applied in step 5*

List it with audit B4. It has no LaTeX cross-check. Until it's decided, the markdown's pin in
`principia_dd_integrator.md` §3.6 (collision beats escape) stands.

## R-7 — Step 3's done-check *(closes RQ-6)*
*24 Sep 2026 · applied in step 3*

Step 3 is done when both of these hold:

**(a)** Run over the corpus markdown only, after step 2's move:

```
grep -rniwE --include='*.md' "latex|spec\.tex" docs/ --exclude-dir=archive
```

It returns only:
- the retirement ruling in `principia_canonical_spec.md`;
- `principia_spec_pending_changes.md`, which is exempt by name until step 4 archives it.

The root working docs (HANDOFF, REVIEW_QUEUE, decisions, open-questions), `spec_sources/`, `workbench/`
and `.git` are out of scope by construction.

**(b)** `spec_sources/SECTION_MAP.md` is the ledger for everything the grep can't judge ("the spec's …"
phrases). Every T, S and D row carries `done: <commit>` or a REVIEW_QUEUE reference. F and M rows need no
action. R rows are closed in step 4.

**After step 4:** rerun (a) with no exemptions. It returns only the retirement ruling.

## R-8 — The IC Inspector copies
*24 Sep 2026 · applied in step 3*

The `docs/` copies are canonical: `docs/gui/reference/ic_inspector.html` (19 Jul, 39.6 KB) and
`docs/notes/ic_inspector_scratchpad.md` (the later, longer one). The `spec_sources/` copies are older
uploads. They go to `docs/archive/` when `spec_sources/` is archived at the end of step 3.

## R-9 — The toolchain spike findings go to results *(closes RQ-7)*
*24 Sep 2026 · applied in step 3*

`docs/archive/findings.md` → `docs/experiments/results/findings.md` (`git mv`). It is the toolchain spike's
findings, the evidence for the rust-gpu decision. Its INDEX row moves with it.

## R-7 amended — part (a)'s grep
*24 Sep 2026 · applied in step 3*

Part (a)'s grep becomes the following. It drops `-w`, because the filename form has an underscore before "spec":

```
grep -rniE --include='*.md' "\blatex\b|spec(_revised)?\.tex" docs/ --exclude-dir=archive
```

The rest of R-7 is unchanged.

## R-10 — μ_max and q_max are settled *(closes RQ-8, amends R-5)*
*24 Sep 2026 · applied in step 3*

`μ_max = 5` and `q_max = 2`. The "4" was the IC Inspector's value before its correction. The values are written
where the constants are defined (`principia_dd_decoder.md` §3, `principia_chart_decoder_contract.md`), and the
formulae keep the symbols. Only `α_min` (0 or 0.05) stays on the step-5 decision sheet.

## R-11 — The per-body momentum cap is rejected *(closes RQ-9)*
*24 Sep 2026 · applied in step 3*

The LaTeX's optional per-body cap isn't invertible: capping each body, then re-imposing CoM, breaks the T2 round
trip. And `q_max` already bounds the Jacobi momenta. It's recorded under rejected ideas in `principia_00_philosophy.md` §8.

## R-12 — The shape-sphere chart map stays as the markdown has it *(closes RQ-10)*
*24 Sep 2026 · applied in step 3*

θ on `v`, no polar buffer. The LaTeX's buffer rests on a wrong premise: the collision points are on the equator,
not at the poles. It's recorded as rejected in `principia_chart_reference.md` §3.3. In Group B, check the colour
PDF §8 axis convention against this and flag any mismatch.

## R-13 — Lookup has no coincident-bodies rejection *(closes RQ-11)*
*24 Sep 2026 · applied in step 3*

A looked-up IC takes the same path as any pixel. Bodies within `r_coll` give a t = 0 collision outcome, which is
a real outcome. Exactly coincident bodies can't be represented, and the lookup ladder's range check catches them with
`lookup_clamped`. `principia_inverse_encode_contract.md`'s validation is updated to match.

## Porting rule — a port adds, it never removes a decision
*24 Sep 2026 · applies from step 3 Group B onward*

A port may add content. It may never delete or change a decision the markdown has made, including the prototype-kernel
decisions in the drill-downs and contracts, without a REVIEW_QUEUE entry and a ruling. Each commit message ends with a
"Removed lines" note. For every removed line it says either "reworded, kept at <file:line>" or "stale value, replaced by
<ruling>". A removed decision with neither is a bug.

## R-14 — One shape-sphere convention, the IC Inspector's *(closes RQ-12, corrects R-12's premise)*
*24 Sep 2026 · applied in step 3*

The convention was validated by the human:

```
u = ‖ρ̃‖² − ‖λ̃‖²,   v = 2 ρ̃·λ̃,   w = 2(ρ̃ ∧ λ̃)   (standard, positive cross)
n = (u, v, w)/I
θ = azimuth in the (u, v) plane, on the horizontal axis, 0..2π
φ = polar angle from +w, on the vertical axis, 0..π; L⁺ (w = +1) at the top
n = (sin φ cos θ, sin φ sin θ, cos φ)
```

Applied as follows:
- chart_reference §3.1: `q` takes the standard sign.
- chart_reference §3.3: the spherical map is rewritten in θ/φ.
- The R-12 note is rewritten. There is no polar buffer, because under this convention the poles are the Lagrange
  points (regular) and every binary collision lies on the equator (w = 0).
- dd_integrator §3.7: the overlay's b̂ landmarks are computed from this formula, not hard-coded. The collision of bodies 0
  and 1 is at n = (−1, 0, 0). Audit decision B18 (mass-weighted positions or fixed 120°) stays open.
- dd_integrator's shape-map tests check the landmarks numerically (BC₀₁ → (−1,0,0), L⁺ → (0,0,+1), all collisions at w = 0,
  equal masses 120° apart) and cross-check `n` against the IC Inspector's JS on random ICs.

## R-15 — `Policy::Tolerance` governs refinement *(closes RQ-13)*
*24 Sep 2026 · applied in step 4*

This follows the INDEX's "current design" and landed pending change 12. The scheduler contract keeps its mechanics and
defers the split decision to `principia_dd_refinement_policy.md`. It's applied in step 4, when change 12 is folded in.

## R-16 — The colour PDF's map lists are ported *(closes RQ-14)*
*24 Sep 2026 · applied in step 3*

The complete Artefact-1 and Artefact-2 map lists go from the retired colour PDF into `principia_colour_composition.md`
(under R-3), and the golden-image tests are pinned to that list. Magenta stays the invalid colour as a plain default,
with no source claimed.

## R-17 — The diffusion sentinel uses the streaming slope *(closes RQ-15)*
*24 Sep 2026 · applied in step 3*

The streaming slope is the one the payload ledger and the payload doc define. `principia_render_contract.md`:79 is updated to cite it.

## R-18 — The agreement value is `spread_event` *(closes RQ-16)*
*24 Sep 2026 · applied in step 3*

`spread_event` is an f16 and is stored, as `principia_dd_generation_root.md`'s ledger defines it. `ensemble_outcome_agreement` is a retired name. The
sampling note cites `spread_event`, and any agreement value is derived from it on the fly.

## R-19 — Change 8 landed in full *(closes RQ-17)*
*24 Sep 2026 · applied in step 4*

`ADVANCE(state, t_now, t_target, params)` is the occupant seam. Part 2b extended it with regularisation as a separate
axis; it didn't replace it. In the integrator contract:
- Part 2a's "PROPOSED CHANGE" becomes "DECIDED (change 8, extended by Part 2b)".
- `owns_time_mapping` is reported for the composed occupant (stepper × regularisation): true whenever the regularisation
  is not `none`.
- The per-substep cadence is a callback passed in.
- Law 18's count bound is on a fixed τ-schedule.

The original rationale text is kept.

## R-20 — No `majority_class` field *(closes RQ-18)*
*24 Sep 2026 · applied in step 4*

The impurity mask compares each sample with `dominant_outcome` at the joint `class ⊕ detail` grain (change 1's
resolution, `principia_dd_generation_root.md` §3.7). The impurity-mask rows in the render contract and in
`principia_debug_tooling_plan.md` say so.
