# Review queue

Items I did not decide. Each gives the file, the section, and both versions where they disagree. The reviewer
or the human rules; I don't choose between them.

Only open entries are kept here (R-292). Once an entry has a ruling it moves, unchanged, to
`docs/archive/review_queue/`: `untangling.md` holds RQ-1 to RQ-128, and `M0.md` RQ-129 onward; each later
milestone gets its own file after its gate. Ids never change.

## RQ-173: TASK-M5-30 allows only `QuadReduction` to be read back per frame; R-288 reads two counters back each frame *(plan, TASK-M5-30, R-288)*

- **File, section:** `plan/tasks/M5/TASK-M5-30.md` § "Acceptance tests", the checklist line for REQ-SYS-033 (also
  REQ-SYS-033's verify detail in `plan/requirements.yaml`): "audit every buffer map/readback: only QuadReduction is read
  back per frame; other readbacks are behind a user action and async". REQ-SYS-033's statement: "QuadReduction must be
  the sole automatic GPU-to-CPU crossing". `decisions.md` § "R-288": "Two per-frame atomic u32 counters … in telemetry
  §2. They ride on the existing profiler/telemetry readback, not a new GPU→CPU channel (QuadReduction stays the sole
  automatic return of simulation data, R-142), and are read back asynchronously with a frame or two of latency, never
  stalling the frame."
- **What:** R-288's counters come back every frame, on the profiler/telemetry readback, with no user action. Read
  literally, TASK-M5-30's checklist line fails on them. R-288's own words arguably settle it: they aren't a new
  GPU→CPU channel, and `QuadReduction` stays the sole automatic return of *simulation data*. REQ-SYS-033's statement
  and checklist don't draw that line. The same task's Goal ("the only automatic GPU → CPU crossing is the
  `QuadReduction` readback") and REQ-SYS-036's line ("finds only the reduction readback and the two sanctioned pulls")
  read the same way.
- **Options seen:**
  1. **Reword REQ-SYS-033 to "simulation data" (recommended).** `QuadReduction` is the only automatic per-frame return
     of simulation data; the profiler/telemetry readback (R-288) is not simulation data. REQ-SYS-033's statement and
     verify detail change through `plan/tools/reqio.py`, and TASK-M5-30's checklist line follows.
  2. **Leave it as written.** TASK-M5-30 reconciles it when it builds the membrane audit, citing R-288.
- **Needed:** which one. Nothing is blocked now: TASK-M5-30 is an M5 task.
