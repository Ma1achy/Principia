# Review queue

Items I did not decide. Each gives the file, the section, and both versions where they disagree. The reviewer
or the human rules; I don't choose between them.

Only open entries are kept here (R-292). Once an entry has a ruling it moves, unchanged, to
`docs/archive/review_queue/`: `untangling.md` holds RQ-1 to RQ-128, and `M0.md` RQ-129 onward; each later
milestone gets its own file after its gate. Ids never change.

## RQ-278: §3.7 grounds `running_mean_divergence`'s and `coherence`'s (−∞, ∞) in the default reading R-426 retires, and `alpha_energy`'s declared (−∞, ∞) `lin` would centre its view on zero where §3.7 says 1.0 *(conflict, R-426, R-400, R-403, R-71, REQ-PAY-093, REQ-PAY-094, REQ-GEN-035; context: TASK-M1-21, TASK-M5-01, the M5 gate)*

*Found by TASK-M1-21's fix round (code review 5511539171 F3), once an uncited (−∞, ∞) became a gap on every ledger.
Nothing is chosen.*

- **File, section:**
  - `docs/design/principia_dd_generation_root.md` § "3.7" "Layout and §3.8 entries", "The §3.8 entries", line 488:
    "an f32 member §3.7 gives no range is `(−∞, ∞)`, as §3.8's worked entries are". The table below it (:500–520)
    writes `(−∞, ∞)` for `alpha_area`, `alpha_energy`, `running_mean_divergence` and `coherence`.
  - The same section, "Scales (REQ-PAY-094)", line 527: "`alpha_energy` is `lin`, centred on its analytic 1.0, not on
    zero."
  - `decisions.md` § "R-426 — …", the human's words: "an undeclared range is a ledger gap, not "spans zero"; a field
    is diverging only when its declared range spans zero (RQ-260)". R-400: a numeric view whose field's declared range
    spans zero is drawn on the diverging ramp, centred at zero.
- **Conflict:**
  - Line 488 makes `running_mean_divergence`'s and `coherence`'s (−∞, ∞) the range a member gets when §3.7 gives it
    none: the default R-426 says declares nothing. Whether the table's row is then a declaration, or a gap the row
    merely writes, the corpus does not say.
  - `alpha_energy`'s row declares (−∞, ∞) and its scale is `lin`, so under R-400 its view would be on the diverging ramp
    centred at zero; line 527 says it is centred on 1.0, not on zero. `alpha_area` (`diverging`, its range spanning
    zero by R-403) does not conflict.
  - The same holds in kind for `running_mean_divergence` and `coherence`. Option (a), applied to the ledger meanwhile
    (`crates/ledger/src/reduction.rs`, the two `.cited(SECTION_3_7)` members at the end of `entries()`), makes both
    `lin` over a declared (−∞, ∞) that spans zero, so under R-400 any view of them is drawn on cool-warm centred at
    zero. The corpus points to both being one-signed:
    - `coherence`: dd_generation_root.md:444 reads "| `coherence` | f32 | priority ordering
      (`complexity = 1 − coherence`) |"; `docs/contracts/principia_scheduler_contract.md` § "Priority" (:133) reads
      "complexity (`1 − coherence`) drives adaptive refinement". `docs/design/principia_debug_tooling_plan.md`:121
      draws it as "| coherence / impurity | scalar heatmap | = reduction output; high where boundaries |";
      the render contract's `RenderQuad` (:15) carries it as `coherence_score`.
    - `running_mean_divergence`: dd_generation_root.md:406 reads "| `running_mean_divergence` | f32 | diagnostic, not
      a split input (R-99) |": the running mean of the per-footprint divergence whose latched running maximum (:410,
      "`running_max_divergence` (f32, max-updated,") is compared with `eps` as a spread (:413, "a footprint is
      unresolved if its spread exceeds `eps` now, or its latched"). A spread is ≥ 0.
    - Neither has a formula in the corpus, so no line fixes either range.
- **Options seen:**
  - (a) Keep the table's rows as declarations: the four are declared (−∞, ∞) citing §3.7's table, and line 488 is
    reworded to cite the rows, not a default; `alpha_energy`'s view is then on cool-warm centred at zero, and line 527
    is reworded.
  - (b) Treat line 488's members as gaps until a requirement declares their ranges, as R-426 does for the payload;
    `running_mean_divergence` and `coherence`, `lin` scalars, then fail generation until it does.
  - (c) For `alpha_energy`, declare a range that does not span zero, or define a placement centred on 1.0 (R-72),
    with REQ-PAY-093's proposal at the M5 gate.
  - (d) For `running_mean_divergence` and `coherence`, make their ranges a definition requirement (R-72): it gives
    each a formula and declares a range, with its citation, that does not span zero.
- **Applied meanwhile:** applied per R-369 in TASK-M1-21's PR (#208): option (a)'s ledger half. The four members cite
  §3.7's "The §3.8 entries" (`crates/ledger/src/reduction.rs`, `SECTION_3_7`), `alpha_area` and `alpha_energy` also
  REQ-PAY-093's proposal (R-71, R-418) until the M5 gate; line 488 and line 527 are unchanged. No numeric view draws
  a `QuadReduction` member in M1, `running_mean_divergence` and `coherence` included (`ledger::layout()` is the
  payload's), so no ramp follows from it yet.
- **Waits:** nothing in M1; TASK-M1-21's PR does not wait. REQ-PAY-093's confirmation at the M5 gate is where
  `alpha_energy`'s range is settled; it is named, not marked.

## RQ-280: The addressing channel convention names two channels per position and "grey" for an index, but not the third channel of TL = RB and centre = BG, which index, or how it maps to [0, 1] *(silence, R-72, REQ-COL-054; context: TASK-M7-01, TASK-M7-17, TASK-M7-18)*

*Found by TASK-M7-01, writing render GUI spec §16's standing gaps into colour_composition §9. Nothing is chosen.*

- **File, section:**
  - `docs/gui/principia_render_gui_spec.md` § "16. Open / next": "the addressing channel convention (UV=RG / TL=RB /
    centre=BG / index=grey)".
  - `docs/design/principia_colour_composition.md` § "6. Debug views as presets": "**UV view** = `colour =
    ctx.screen.uv → RG` (fragment addressing) or `ctx.quad.uv → RG` (structural addressing)".
  - `docs/design/principia_debug_tooling_plan.md` § "F. Structural views", the "UV passthrough" row: "raw post-flip
    `(u,v)` as a gradient (`u→red, v→green`), + quad-local `δ` as a second mode: … `u`'s in red and `v`'s in green,
    blue 0 (REQ-TOOL-153; R-72, written by TASK-M1-07; in exact arithmetic it draws `t`, as `ctx.quad.uv → RG` does,
    so the two agree unless the δ path is wrong)".
  - `docs/design/principia_colour_composition.md` § "3. The `ctx` contract", the quad lane: "`index`, `depth`, `tl`
    (slice coords), `centre` (slice coords), …"; the tile/sample lane: "`tile_index` (within quad), `sample_index`".
- **Silence:**
  - UV = RG's third channel is written: §F's δ mode draws blue 0 and agrees with `ctx.quad.uv → RG`, which holds
    only with that view's blue 0 too, so colour_composition §9.7 writes B = 0 for UV = RG (both sources, §6's one UV
    view). For TL = RB and centre = BG the passages name two channels; the third (G and R; 0, or something else) is
    not written. colour_composition §9.7 writes the pairs' order (`x` → first, `y` → second) by the pattern of
    `u → red, v → green`.
  - "index = grey" does not say which index: `ctx.quad.index`, `ctx.tile.tile_index` or `ctx.tile.sample_index`.
  - An index is an integer, and grey takes a value in [0, 1]; no mapping is written (divided by a count, a hash, or
    a cyclic modulus).
- **Options seen:**
  - (a) TL = RB's G and centre = BG's R are 0, as UV = RG's B is.
  - (b) "index" is `ctx.quad.index`, mapped by a stated normalisation (for example over the visible quads), or a
    hash to grey as `word`-hash's categorical view.
  - (c) One preset per index (quad, tile, sample), each with its own mapping.
- **Applied meanwhile:** nothing; colour_composition §9.7 writes only what the passages name.
- **Waits:** the addressing presets' payloads in TASK-M7-17's preset library, and any map preset that uses the
  convention (TASK-M7-18). TASK-M7-01 does not wait.

## RQ-281: Render GUI spec §11 names six debug groups, but the passages settle the membership of four; diagnostic's and profiling's, and where ROUNDTRIP, the agreement presets, the §B–§D payload field views and §E's live-shape and accumulator views go, are not written, and the telemetry doc says profiling is "not a debug mode" *(silence and possible conflict, R-72, REQ-COL-054; context: TASK-M7-01, TASK-M7-17)*

*Found by TASK-M7-01, writing render GUI spec §16's "the debug taxonomy" into colour_composition §9.6. Nothing is
chosen.*

- **File, section:**
  - `docs/gui/principia_render_gui_spec.md` § "11. Presets = whole graphs": "the debug groups — addressing /
    quad-structure / decoded-IC / validity / diagnostic / profiling — below".
  - `docs/design/principia_colour_composition.md` § "6. Debug views as presets": the §B–§E payload field views
    (`f_edrift`, `f_wordhash`, `f_state`), the §F `ctx.quad` presets (`s_depth`, `s_impurity`, `s_state`), and the §A
    views (UV, DECODE, ROUNDTRIP, "Agreement presets").
  - `docs/design/principia_debug_tooling_plan.md` § "E. Payload field views — `ICDescriptor` (64 B) & the live-state
    block": "*ICDescriptor views certify the **decoder**, independent of any integration.*" Its table also holds the
    "**live shape views** `u_mode`" and "accumulator views" rows, which are live state, not the `ICDescriptor`.
  - `docs/design/principia_dd_telemetry_and_tiers.md` § "5.5 Profiling is FIRST-CLASS, not a debug mode":
    "`stage_ms` and the frame record are part of the render loop's contract, always present, with the *reporting*
    toggleable rather than the *measurement*."
- **Silence:** addressing (§6's UV views), quad-structure (§6's `ctx.quad` presets), decoded-IC (the decoded-IC payload
  quantities, §E's `ICDescriptor` views by §E's line above, and DECODE) and validity (§3's validity lane) follow from
  the passages, and colour_composition §9.6 writes them. No passage names a preset of the diagnostic or the
  profiling group, or places ROUNDTRIP, the agreement presets, the §B–§D payload field views (such as `f_edrift`,
  `f_wordhash` and `f_state`), or §E's live-shape and accumulator views.
- **Possible conflict:** a "profiling" group of locked debug colour presets beside §5.5's "Profiling is FIRST-CLASS, not
  a debug mode". The two may not disagree (§5.5 is about measurement always being on, not about how a view of it is
  filed), but no passage says what a profiling preset colours.
- **Options seen:**
  - (a) diagnostic holds the §B–§D payload field views, §E's live-shape and accumulator views, and the cross-checks
    (ROUNDTRIP, agreement); profiling holds views of per-sample cost (`total_substeps`, the substep-log proxy) and
    quad cache age.
  - (b) ROUNDTRIP and the agreement presets go in decoded-IC, as checks of the decode; diagnostic holds the §B–§D
    payload field views and §E's live-shape and accumulator views.
  - (c) The membership is the render-modes prototype's grouping, transcribed into a contract by a ruling (R-159).
- **Applied meanwhile:** nothing; colour_composition §9.6 writes the four groups the passages settle and points here.
- **Waits:** TASK-M7-17's preset library, for the diagnostic and profiling rows. TASK-M7-01 does not wait.

## RQ-282: "Gradient-unifies-the-ramp" may mean the GUI's gradient editor ("built-in LUT or custom stops") unifies §1.2's ramps, and colour_composition has no ramp of custom stops *(silence, R-72, REQ-COL-054; context: TASK-M7-01, TASK-M7-11)*

*Found by TASK-M7-01. Nothing is chosen.*

- **File, section:**
  - `docs/gui/principia_render_gui_spec.md` § "16. Open / next": "gradient-unifies-the-ramp".
  - `plan/tasks/M7/TASK-M7-01.md`, Deliverables: "`FieldRamp{gradient_magnitude}` vs the map post node (§1.2,
    render_contract Part 4)" — the reading colour_composition §9.4 writes.
  - `docs/gui/principia_render_gui_spec.md` § "9. Node inspector — morphing editors": "`colour` ← `scalar` |
    **gradient editor** (built-in LUT or custom stops, cyclic)"; "`brightness` ← any | **gradient / compaction
    editor** (greyscale + polarity)".
  - `docs/design/principia_colour_composition.md` § "1.2 Family B — field-ramp": "**Ramp** (scalar → colour):
    `lut(name)`, `lerp(c0,c1)`, `diverging(c−,c0,c+)` (through a neutral), `bands(…)`".
- **Silence:** the item's name fits two readings. The task file's, written in colour_composition §9.4: gradient
  magnitude is a ramp over a derived field, distinct from the map's post-occupant gradient. The other: one "gradient" (a stop list) is the GUI's
  single form of §1.2's `lut`, `lerp` and `diverging`. Under the second, §1.2 has no ramp of custom stops: their
  interpolation space (OKLab or sRGB), the stops' positions, and how `cyclic` (a compaction in §1.2, a gradient
  flag in render GUI spec §9) applies are not written.
- **Options seen:**
  - (a) The task file's reading alone; render GUI spec §9's custom stops are a separate definition, written by the
    task that needs it (R-72).
  - (b) Both: §1.2 gains `stops([(t_i, c_i)], space)`, with `lut`, `lerp` and `diverging` as its named instances.
- **Applied meanwhile:** colour_composition §9.4 writes the task file's reading and points here.
- **Waits:** TASK-M7-11's graph model, for the gradient editor's ramp type. TASK-M7-01 does not wait.

## RQ-283: chart_reference §0.3 names `Σpᵢ = 0` "the test that catches a swap", but the full swap of the crossed factors keeps `Σpᵢ = 0` at every mass *(corpus error, REQ-DEC-019, PIT-9; context: TASK-M2-03)*

*Found by TASK-M2-03's review (physics review 5526305435 E1; qa review 5527243917). Nothing is chosen; TASK-M2-03's PR
does not wait.*

- **File, section:**
  - `docs/design/principia_chart_reference.md` § "0.3 Momentum — free Jacobi momenta", the "Transcription hazard"
    note (:85–88): "Transcribe it, then verify by asserting `Σpᵢ = 0` to machine precision — the test that catches a
    swap."
  - `plan/tasks/M2/TASK-M2-03.md` § "Acceptance tests", `decode_momentum`: "Σpᵢ = 0 to machine precision on fuzzed z
    with unequal masses (catches the crossed m₀/m₁ factors)"; `plan/requirements.yaml` REQ-DEC-019's acceptance
    detail (:383) repeats it.
- **Why it is wrong:** the map is `p₀ = −p_ρ − w₀p_λ`, `p₁ = p_ρ − w₁p_λ`, `p₂ = p_λ` with `w₀ = m₀/M₀₁`,
  `w₁ = m₁/M₀₁`. Swapping both factors (`p₀` taking `w₁`, `p₁` taking `w₀`, the positions' form) gives
  `Σp = −(w₁ + w₀)p_λ + p_λ = 0` at every mass. `Σpᵢ = 0` catches only a one-sided swap, so PIT-9's "draw unequal
  masses" is necessary but not sufficient.
- **What catches it:** the conjugacy of the map, `μ_ρ(p₁/m₁ − p₀/m₀) = p_ρ` (TASK-M2-03's `decode_momentum`, its
  `swapped_factors` control), or the kinetic-energy identity `Σ‖pᵢ‖²/2mᵢ = ‖p_ρ‖²/2μ_ρ + ‖p_λ‖²/2μ_λ` (qa's
  `qa_m2_03_momentum`). Both fail under the full swap at unequal masses.
- **Options seen:**
  - (a) Reword §0.3's note, and REQ-DEC-019's detail and the task line with it, to name the conjugacy check (or the
    kinetic-energy identity) as the test that catches the swap, `Σpᵢ = 0` as the one that catches a one-sided swap.
  - (b) Keep the note and add the conjugacy check beside it as a second required assertion.
- **Applied meanwhile:** TASK-M2-03's tests assert both `Σpᵢ = 0` and the conjugacy, with a control for each swap; no
  doc line is changed.
- **Waits:** nothing.

## RQ-286: profiler schema v1's frame record has no per-pixel substep field, so nothing records what the Profiler's substeps-per-pixel histogram draws *(silence, REQ-TOOL-098; context: TASK-M8-28, TASK-M6-28)*

*Found by TASK-M6-28's fix round (gui review 5529720235, finding 3 of PR #212), drawing the histogram on the mock.
Nothing is chosen.*

- **File, section:**
  - `docs/gui/principia_render_gui_spec.md` § "G5" › "Profiler", line 237: "a substeps-per-pixel histogram, with the
    cap marked (the long tail near close encounters is the GPU divergence);". GUI_DESIGN_NOTES § "04 Windows" (:69)
    lists it too, and REQ-TOOL-098 asks for it.
  - `docs/design/principia_dd_telemetry_and_tiers.md` § "5. The artefact: one file, plain text, readable by the
    sender", "The frame record" (:340–354): "**The frame record** is §2's, key for key, followed by the five stages'
    nested sections and the memory live at the frame's end"; its one substep key is line 346's
    "quads_computed  quads_reused  samples  substeps_total". § "2. What to record" (:46) reads "substeps_total     the
    honest cost measure; steps are not comparable across steppers": a frame's total only.
- **Silence:** the histogram needs a distribution of substeps over pixels, but the frame record carries only the
  frame's total, and no other field of schema v1 (header, stages, events) carries per-pixel substeps. The corpus
  does not say whether the histogram is a new frame-record field (its bins, their width or edges, and whether the cap
  is its own bin), a stage section's payload, or something the GUI reads elsewhere (`total_substeps` per pixel,
  render contract :384), nor what readback carries it (R-288 keeps `QuadReduction` unchanged).
- **Options seen:**
  - (a) Add a frame-record field, e.g. `substep_histogram: [u32; n]` with fixed bin edges up to `N_max` and the cap
    hits as the last bin, read back with the telemetry counters (R-288), a schema v1 change by ruling.
  - (b) Compute it on demand from the per-pixel `total_substeps` (a sanctioned pull), outside the trace, so a saved
    trace does not carry it.
  - (c) Drop the histogram from §G5 and REQ-TOOL-098.
- **Applied meanwhile:** applied per R-369 in TASK-M6-28's PR (#212): the mock's Profiler draws placeholder bins of
  4 substeps up to `N_max` 64 (`crates/gui/src/mock/profile.rs`, `SUBSTEPS_PER_PIXEL`), the cap marked at 64, with a
  note naming this entry; the real engine's side has no trace, so draws nothing.
- **Waits:** TASK-M8-28 (REQ-TOOL-098's histogram on real data). TASK-M6-28 does not wait.

## RQ-295: When `lookup_rescaled` is raised: step 0 always rescales and records `λ`, but a notice must fire only if its operation did, and canonical inputs raise none *(silence, R-72, REQ-ENC-006, REQ-ENC-014; context: TASK-M2-07, TASK-M2-15)*

*Found by TASK-M2-07, building `C`. Nothing is chosen.*

- **File, section:**
  - `docs/design/principia_dd_encode.md` § "3.2 Canonicalisation `C` — the exact ordered procedure", step 0 (:73–75):
    "`0  SCALE      I_in = Σ mᵢ‖rᵢ‖²  (CoM frame)          → r ← r/√I_in ;  p ← I_in^{1/4}·p`" and
    "`record λ = I_in^{−1/2} ; notice lookup_rescaled`": the step runs, and the notice is issued, on every input.
  - `docs/contracts/principia_inverse_encode_contract.md` § "Part 2 — The scale gauge gap (missing from the original
    inverse policy)" (:50): "Encode surfaces a **`lookup_rescaled`** notice carrying `λ`"; § "Part 6 — The canonical
    inverse policy, completed" (:167): "**0. Rescale to `I = 1`** via the similarity transform (Part 2). Record `λ`;
    notice `lookup_rescaled`."
  - `docs/design/principia_dd_encode.md` § "4. Seams (obligations → integration tests)", seam 8 (:128): "the three
    `lookup_*` notices fire iff their operation did"; REQ-ENC-014's statement, "lookup_rescaled, lookup_mirrored and
    lookup_clamped must each fire if and only if their operation did", and its verify detail, "canonical inputs raise
    no notice".
- **Silence:** a canonical-frame decode has `I = 1` only to rounding (TASK-M2-07 measures `|I − 1|` up to 3 eps at
  f64 and f32 on its output), so step 0 computes `λ = 1 ± a few ulps` and moves `r` and `p` by an ulp or so. Read
  literally, Part 2 and step 0 raise `lookup_rescaled` on every input; read with seam 8 and REQ-ENC-014, a canonical
  input raises none. The corpus does not say what counts as "the rescale's operation happened": `λ ≠ 1` bit for bit, a
  tolerance on `|I_in − 1|` (and so a calibration), or something else; nor whether step 0 is skipped where the notice is
  not raised, which would make `C` an exact no-op on canonical decodes (dd_decoder §5 test 5 asks only "rotation angle
  ≈ 0, mirror not taken").
- **Options seen:**
  - (a) Raise it iff `λ ≠ 1` bit for bit; step 0 always runs. Canonical decodes then raise it at most rounding
    rescales, against REQ-ENC-014's "canonical inputs raise no notice".
  - (b) Raise it iff `|I_in − 1| > τ_I`, a new calibration constant (R-71) in eps of the precision, and still run step 0
    everywhere; the notice reports a rescale the user would notice, not rounding.
  - (c) As (b), and skip step 0 (select `λ = 1`, `r`, `p` unchanged) where `|I_in − 1| ≤ τ_I`, so `C` is an exact
    no-op in scale on canonical input and the notice fires exactly when the state was rescaled.
  - (d) Always raise it (every lookup reports `λ`), and amend REQ-ENC-014's "canonical inputs raise no notice" for
    `lookup_rescaled`.
- **Applied meanwhile:** `kernel::canon::canonicalise` (TASK-M2-07) runs step 0 on every input and records `λ` in its
  output (`Canonical::lambda`, the notice's value); it forms no raised/not-raised flag for `lookup_rescaled`.
  `lookup_clamped` and `lookup_mirrored` are flags, each raised iff its operation did. `scale_step` asserts `λ = 1/2`
  is carried on the 2× Burrau state, which every option raises.
- **Waits:** REQ-ENC-006's and REQ-ENC-014's notice (`rq: RQ-295`): TASK-M2-07's closing of REQ-ENC-006, and
  TASK-M2-15's of REQ-ENC-014.

## RQ-296: What `C` outputs where `I_in` is 0 or rounds to 0 or `+∞`: all three bodies coinciding, an underflowing or an overflowing state, where step 0 divides by `√I_in` before step 2's guard *(silence, R-72, R-23, R-13, R-436, REQ-DEC-002; context: TASK-M2-07, TASK-M2-15)*

*Found by TASK-M2-07, building `C`. Nothing is chosen.*

- **File, section:**
  - `decisions.md` § "R-23 — Encode order: CoM subtraction precedes `I` *(CD-3)*": "The operational order 1a subtract
    CoM → 0 rescale → 1b subtract boost → 2 rotate → 3 mirror is normative." So step 0's `r ← r/√I_in` runs before
    step 2's `ρ = 0` guard.
  - `docs/design/principia_dd_encode.md` § "3.2 Canonicalisation `C` — the exact ordered procedure", step 0:
    "`r ← r/√I_in ;  p ← I_in^{1/4}·p`", "`record λ = I_in^{−1/2}`"; step 2: "`ρ = 0 → reject (coincident inner
    pair)`", which R-13 makes `lookup_clamped`.
  - `decisions.md` § "R-13 — Lookup has no coincident-bodies rejection *(closes RQ-11)*": "Exactly coincident bodies
    can't be represented, and the lookup ladder's range check catches them with `lookup_clamped`."
    `docs/contracts/principia_inverse_encode_contract.md` § "Part 6", step 2: "`ρ̃ = 0` (exactly coincident inner pair)
    can't be represented → `lookup_clamped` (R-13)."
  - `decisions.md` § "R-436 — …", *Applied*, "The producers select the pole values": a producer never forms `±∞` by
    `1/0`, and chooses a pole's value by comparing its divisor with 0 and a select.
- **Silence:** with positive masses, `I_in = 0` exactly when the three bodies coincide. Then `ρ = 0`, and R-13 and
  Part 6 give the notice, `lookup_clamped`; R-437 gives step 2's `φ = 0`. But step 0 runs first and divides by
  `√I_in = 0`, and nothing defines `C`'s output there: `λ = I_in^{−1/2}` is `+∞`, `r/√I_in` is `0/0`, and
  `I_in^{1/4}·p` is `0` (a state with no kinetic energy). No section point has `I = 1` and all bodies at one place.
  In floating point `I_in` also reaches 0 and `+∞` with the bodies apart (physics review 5542989202 P1), where the
  corpus is as silent:
  - **Underflow:** `I_in` rounds to 0 while the bodies are still apart: at f64 below about `1e-162` per coordinate
    (e.g. `r₀,₁ = ∓1e-170`, masses `(¼, ¼, ½)`), at f32 below about `4e-23` (about `1e-19` where a GPU
    flushes subnormals). There `ρ ≠ 0`, so no `lookup_clamped` fires, and step 0 cannot reach `I = 1`.
  - **Overflow:** `I_in` rounds to `+∞`, at f64 above about `1e154` per coordinate and at f32 above about `1e19`. Then
    `λ = 0`, `r/√I_in` is `±0`, and `I_in^{1/4}·p` is `±∞`, or `0·∞` = NaN for a zero component; and WGSL may assume
    there are no infinities (R-436), so the GPU's arithmetic there is not pinned.
- **Options seen:**
  - (a) Skip step 0 at `I_in = 0` (select divisor 1, so `r` stays as it is, `p` unscaled, `λ = 1`), and let
    `lookup_clamped` carry the coincident case: the state passes through un-normalised and flagged. Underflow and
    overflow are not covered by this alone.
  - (b) Record `λ = +∞` by its bits (R-436's producer rule), `r = 0`, `p = 0`, flagged `lookup_clamped`.
  - (c) Define `C`'s output there as a fixed sentinel state, or as undefined with the flag the only output a consumer
    may read (the validation ladder rejects the pixel before decode).
  - (d) For underflow and overflow: rescale in two steps (by a power of two first, exact, then by the rest), so `I_in`
    is formed from scaled coordinates and neither rounds to 0 nor `+∞` for any finite state with the bodies apart.
  - (e) For underflow and overflow: a range check on `I_in` (against calibrated bounds, R-71) that raises
    `lookup_clamped`, or a notice of its own, with the output defined as in (a), (b) or (c).
- **Applied meanwhile:** `kernel::canon::similarity` (TASK-M2-07) selects the divisor `√I_in` as 1 where `I_in = 0`,
  so no `1/0` is formed (R-436). What the code then does in each case (`crates/kernel/src/canon.rs`, the module's
  note):
  - **`I_in = 0`, bodies coincident:** `r` stays 0, `p ← I_in^{1/4}·p = 0`, `λ = 1`, `lookup_clamped`, `φ = +0`.
  - **`I_in` rounded to 0, bodies apart:** the same select, so `r` is left unscaled (`I ≈ 0`, not 1), every momentum
    becomes 0 (`√√0 = 0`), `λ = 1`, and, since `ρ ≠ 0`, no `lookup_clamped`: the state leaves `C` off the section,
    unflagged.
  - **`I_in = +∞`:** `r` becomes `±0`, `λ = 0`, every momentum NaN on the CPU (`±∞` or `0·∞`, then step 1b's sums and
    the rotation), `ρ = 0` so `lookup_clamped` and `φ = 0`; on the GPU the arithmetic on `∞` is unpinned.

  That only keeps the arithmetic free of `1/0`. The tests assert `lookup_clamped` and `φ = +0` at the coincident case
  (R-13, R-437) and that the GPU forms no non-finite value there; at underflow, that the case is reached and no `1/0` is
  formed (every output finite, `canon_inertia_extremes`); at overflow, only that the case is reached. Nothing about the
  state or `λ`.
- **Waits:** REQ-DEC-002 (`rq: RQ-296`), TASK-M2-07's closing of it.
