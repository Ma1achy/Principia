# Review queue

Items I did not decide. Each gives the file, the section, and both versions where they disagree. The reviewer
or the human rules; I don't choose between them.

Only open entries are kept here (R-292). Once an entry has a ruling it moves, unchanged, to
`docs/archive/review_queue/`: `untangling.md` holds RQ-1 to RQ-128, and `M0.md` RQ-129 onward; each later
milestone gets its own file after its gate. Ids never change.

## RQ-278: §3.7 grounds `running_mean_divergence`'s and `coherence`'s (−∞, ∞) in the default reading R-426 retires, and `alpha_energy`'s declared (−∞, ∞) `lin` would centre its view on zero where §3.7 says 1.0 *(conflict, R-426, R-400, R-403, R-71, REQ-PAY-093, REQ-PAY-094, REQ-GEN-035; context: TASK-M1-21, TASK-M5-01, the M5 gate)*

*Found by TASK-M1-21's fix round (code review 5511539171 F3), once an uncited (−∞, ∞) became a gap on every ledger.
Nothing is chosen.*

- **File, section:**
  - `docs/design/principia_dd_generation_root.md` § "3.7" "Layout and §3.8 entries", "The §3.8 entries", line 488:
    "an f32 member §3.7 gives no range is `(−∞, ∞)`, as §3.8's worked entries are". The table below it (:500–520)
    writes `(−∞, ∞)` for `alpha_area`, `alpha_energy`, `running_mean_divergence` and `coherence`.
  - The same section, "Scales (REQ-PAY-094)", line 527: "`alpha_energy` is `lin`, centred on its analytic 1.0, not on
    zero."
  - `decisions.md` § "R-426 — …", the human's words: "an undeclared range is a ledger gap, not "spans zero"; a field
    is diverging only when its declared range spans zero (RQ-260)". R-400: a numeric view whose field's declared range
    spans zero is drawn on the diverging ramp, centred at zero.
- **Conflict:**
  - Line 488 makes `running_mean_divergence`'s and `coherence`'s (−∞, ∞) the range a member gets when §3.7 gives it
    none: the default R-426 says declares nothing. Whether the table's row is then a declaration, or a gap the row
    merely writes, the corpus does not say.
  - `alpha_energy`'s row declares (−∞, ∞) and its scale is `lin`, so under R-400 its view would be on the diverging ramp
    centred at zero; line 527 says it is centred on 1.0, not on zero. `alpha_area` (`diverging`, its range spanning
    zero by R-403) does not conflict.
  - The same holds in kind for `running_mean_divergence` and `coherence`. Option (a), applied to the ledger meanwhile
    (`crates/ledger/src/reduction.rs`, the two `.cited(SECTION_3_7)` members at the end of `entries()`), makes both
    `lin` over a declared (−∞, ∞) that spans zero, so under R-400 any view of them is drawn on cool-warm centred at
    zero. The corpus points to both being one-signed:
    - `coherence`: dd_generation_root.md:444 reads "| `coherence` | f32 | priority ordering
      (`complexity = 1 − coherence`) |"; `docs/contracts/principia_scheduler_contract.md` § "Priority" (:133) reads
      "complexity (`1 − coherence`) drives adaptive refinement". `docs/design/principia_debug_tooling_plan.md`:121
      draws it as "| coherence / impurity | scalar heatmap | = reduction output; high where boundaries |";
      the render contract's `RenderQuad` (:15) carries it as `coherence_score`.
    - `running_mean_divergence`: dd_generation_root.md:406 reads "| `running_mean_divergence` | f32 | diagnostic, not
      a split input (R-99) |": the running mean of the per-footprint divergence whose latched running maximum (:410,
      "`running_max_divergence` (f32, max-updated,") is compared with `eps` as a spread (:413, "a footprint is
      unresolved if its spread exceeds `eps` now, or its latched"). A spread is ≥ 0.
    - Neither has a formula in the corpus, so no line fixes either range.
- **Options seen:**
  - (a) Keep the table's rows as declarations: the four are declared (−∞, ∞) citing §3.7's table, and line 488 is
    reworded to cite the rows, not a default; `alpha_energy`'s view is then on cool-warm centred at zero, and line 527
    is reworded.
  - (b) Treat line 488's members as gaps until a requirement declares their ranges, as R-426 does for the payload;
    `running_mean_divergence` and `coherence`, `lin` scalars, then fail generation until it does.
  - (c) For `alpha_energy`, declare a range that does not span zero, or define a placement centred on 1.0 (R-72),
    with REQ-PAY-093's proposal at the M5 gate.
  - (d) For `running_mean_divergence` and `coherence`, make their ranges a definition requirement (R-72): it gives
    each a formula and declares a range, with its citation, that does not span zero.
- **Applied meanwhile:** applied per R-369 in TASK-M1-21's PR (#208): option (a)'s ledger half. The four members cite
  §3.7's "The §3.8 entries" (`crates/ledger/src/reduction.rs`, `SECTION_3_7`), `alpha_area` and `alpha_energy` also
  REQ-PAY-093's proposal (R-71, R-418) until the M5 gate; line 488 and line 527 are unchanged. No numeric view draws
  a `QuadReduction` member in M1, `running_mean_divergence` and `coherence` included (`ledger::layout()` is the
  payload's), so no ramp follows from it yet.
- **Waits:** nothing in M1; TASK-M1-21's PR does not wait. REQ-PAY-093's confirmation at the M5 gate is where
  `alpha_energy`'s range is settled; it is named, not marked.

## RQ-279: the M1 gate's message confirms nine calibrations by name; six other M1 calibrations, each "confirmed by the human at the M1 gate", are not named *(silence, R-71, R-428, R-432; REQ-INT-086, REQ-COL-053, REQ-COL-062, REQ-COL-064, REQ-TOOL-152, REQ-VAL-122; context: the M1 gate)*

*Found in porting the human's message of 14 Oct 2026 (R-428 to R-432). Nothing is chosen.*

- **File, section:**
  - `decisions.md` § "R-428 — …", the human's words: "Gate M1 passes. Calibrations confirmed as proposed:
    log_floor_d_min 2⁻¹⁴ …, hatch_half_period 4 px." The list is the nine constants-register entries the gate report's
    `gate-provisional` job listed.
  - `plan/MILESTONES.md` § "M1 — The synthetic payload and the eyes", the exit gate, holds six more calibration
    requirements (R-71), none a register entry, each of whose statements ends "confirmed by the human at the M1 gate
    and recorded in decisions.md": **REQ-INT-086** (`r_pole`, the unwrapped phase's pole radius), **REQ-COL-053** (the
    "not yet" neutral grey, PR #172's `#4E4E4E`), **REQ-COL-062** (the two triple-outcome swatches), **REQ-COL-064**
    (the "not yet" dot stipple), **REQ-TOOL-152** (the UV preset's banding criterion, PR #160's bound) and
    **REQ-VAL-122** (the ‖n‖ = 1 paired test's tolerance).
- **Silence:** the message passes the gate and confirms nine values by name. Whether passing the gate confirms the
  six others as proposed, or whether they are still to be confirmed, it does not say, and no other ruling records
  their confirmation.
- **Options seen:**
  - (a) The gate's passing confirms the six as proposed; each is recorded confirmed, citing the ruling.
  - (b) The human confirms or changes each, one by one, as at M0 (R-376).
  - (c) Some are confirmed now and the rest carried to a later gate, as R-419 did for two floors.
- **Applied meanwhile:** none is recorded as confirmed (R-428). Each proposed value stands as built and is used
  provisionally (R-182); the gate has passed (R-432) and is not reopened.
- **Waits:** nothing. M2 does not read these values; a change to one, if the human makes it, is a follow-up PR.
