//! Encode into the active chart, by axis kind (inverse_encode_contract Parts 5 and 6; dd_encode §3.1, §3.2 steps 4–6;
//! REQ-ENC-008, REQ-ENC-009, REQ-ENC-010, REQ-CHART-005): `E(x)` ([`super::encode`]) puts `x` on the canonical section
//! and gives its latent `z`, always available. [`encode_into`] then reads the active chart's point `c(x)` off `C(x)`,
//! axis by axis, and lands on the chart where the chart represents `x`, otherwise in latent `z`.
//!
//! **By kind** ([`ByKind`], one impl per chart type; chart_decoder_contract § "The four axis kinds"):
//! - **Kind 1, raw latent** ([`component`], [`plane`]): the axis's component of `E(x)`'s `z`, exact. On the latent chart
//!   the two directions `q₁`, `q₂` need not be orthogonal, so the components are the solution of the plane's 2×2 Gram
//!   system, which for `q = ê_k` is `z_k − z₀,k` itself.
//! - **Kind 2, derived in block** ([`derived`], [`Residual`]): the block inverse's own value (`α`, `β`, a Jacobi
//!   momentum component), plus the axis's residual convention. A mixed chart's derived axis has no residual: the
//!   block's other control is frozen; the ternary mass plot's two axes pin the mass block together, and the shape
//!   sphere's the configuration block (the chart map's inverse). An `m₀` axis must declare one ([`HoldRatio`], [`HoldEqual`]): the convention is
//!   one function, [`Residual::masses`], which the forward axis ([`Residual::controls`]) and encode both call, so
//!   encoding `m₀ = 0.4` under two conventions gives two `z`, and each round trip closes only under its own.
//! - **Kind 3, invariant** ([`invariants`], [`fibre`]): state → chart coordinates evaluates `L_z(x)`, `E(x)` and `K(x)`
//!   directly, no solve; chart coordinates → latent runs the chart's own forward construction at the frozen
//!   configuration, exactly as a pixel does (`crate::chart::invariant`'s `InvariantBlocks`), and free-momentum-inverts
//!   the constructed `p` through the registry's momentum links (`super::blocks::invert`). Encode reuses decode, so an
//!   entered `(L_z, E)` and the clicked pixel land on one `z`; smallest-latent-norm is not used, there being a
//!   construction.
//! - **Annotation** ([`Coord::Annotation`]): nothing to invert; the axis gives no coordinate and nothing is compared
//!   for it.
//! - **Kind 4, coupled curve**: the Burrau family's encode, its closed form and off-curve projection, is
//!   TASK-M2-18's; no impl here.
//!
//! **Lowered, never interpreted** (chart_decoder_contract design axiom 4; lowering Part 2): the kind is each chart
//! type's impl, monomorphised, as the decode is; the kernel holds no runtime axis-kind value. The authoring layer's
//! `AxisKind` (`engine::chart_authoring`) describes the same axes, CPU-side.
//!
//! **Where possible** (inverse_encode_contract Part 6, step 4's definition, R-72): `x` lands on the chart iff
//! `‖D(Φ(c(x))) − C(x)‖_phys ≤ ε_phys`, `D(Φ(c(x)))` the chart's decode at `c(x)`
//! ([`crate::chart::ChartDecode::decode_at`]), both states canonical: Part 4's norm (REQ-ENC-029) and tolerance
//! (REQ-ENC-024). [`encode_into`] takes both from its caller, the lookup, and fixes neither. A coordinate that is not
//! finite, or an axis that cannot place the state ([`Coord::Unplaced`]), lands it in latent `z` with no comparison.
//!
//! **The branch inputs** (R-34; gpu_determinism_note, "The discipline", rules 1, 2, 4 and 6). The kernel builds this
//! module to f32 SPIR-V, so every float that decides a branch or a select is built in a fixed form, every sum of
//! products an explicit `fma`, and no `±∞` or NaN literal is written. Each divisor a select guards is itself selected
//! as 1 there, so no `x/0` is formed (R-436's producer rule):
//! - **The landing**, in [`encode_into`]: the caller's norm against the caller's `ε_phys`, `d ≤ ε_phys`, so a NaN `d`
//!   lands in latent `z`; `placed`'s finiteness test on each coordinate.
//! - **`plane`'s Gram determinant**, in [`plane`]: `det = g₁₁g₂₂ − g₁₂²` against 0, in Kahan's form, `w = g₁₂·g₁₂`,
//!   `det = fma(g₁₁, g₂₂, −w) + fma(−g₁₂, g₁₂, w)`, which is exactly 0 wherever the rounded Gram entries satisfy
//!   `g₁₁g₂₂ = g₁₂²`; each `g` and the right-hand side is `dot`, a chain of explicit `fma`s from the lone first product.
//! - **The ternary plot's edge `u = 1`**, in [`MassSimplex`]'s impl: `v`'s divisor `k − (m₁ − ε_m)` against 0, lone
//!   subtractions, no division.
//! - **The pole and `θ`'s sign**, in [`spherical_inverse`]: `n₀`, `n₁` against 0, `θ`'s sign decided on `n₁`, never on
//!   `atan2`'s output; the pole's `θ` is selected as 0, as `crate::canon`'s rotation angle selects `φ` (R-437).
//! - **The centre**, in [`exponential_inverse`]: `‖n⊥‖²`, a chain of explicit `fma`s, against 0, not its `sqrt`.
//! - **The warp at rest**, in [`warp_inverse`]: `K` against 0, where `L_max(K) = 0`, not `L_max` itself.
//! - **Feasibility**, in [`feasibility`]: the finiteness of the entries; the construction's own exact test
//!   (`crate::decode::invariant::infeasible`); `K*` against 0, and `L_z` against 0, for the constraint named and the
//!   class kept.
//!
//! **Feasibility first** ([`feasibility`]; Part 5 kind 3, Part 6 "Chart-aware validation"; REQ-ENC-010, REQ-ENC-030).
//! An entered pair is tested before the construction, by the construction's own exact test `2·I·K* < L_z²`
//! (`crate::decode::invariant::infeasible`, `I = 1`). An infeasible pair is projected by the contract's metric: `K*`
//! (so `E`) held and `L_z` moved onto the parabola on its own side, `L_z ← sign(L_z)·L_max(K*)`, `L_max` the chart's own
//! (`crate::chart::invariant::l_max`), held so that `L_z² ≤ 2K*` exactly; where `K* < 0`, to the apex `(0, 0)`, the rest
//! start. It is rejected where that changes the class of `sign(L_z)`: `L_z ≠ 0` with `K* ≤ 0`. The contract's other
//! class, `sign(E)`, is kept by every such projection (`E` is held, or raised from below `U` to `U < 0`), so it is not
//! tested. A non-finite entry is rejected, never carried as a NaN. The constraint named is the chart's
//! ([`InvariantAxis`]), as its `validate` names it. Layer 1, the hypercube, is the momentum links' clamp
//! (`lookup_clamped`, [`Lookup::Encoded`]'s `clamped`).
//!
//! **DEGENERATE** (Part 5 kind 3; R-82). Where no seed qualifies, the fibre returns [`Lookup::Degenerate`], the
//! construction's `Outcome::Degenerate`, the label the pixel path gives. On a configuration of the canonical-frame
//! decode the seed rule never degenerates (`crate::decode::invariant`'s note: the largest norm is at least ½), so an
//! invariant chart's frozen configuration never gives it; a configuration from elsewhere takes the rule on its computed
//! norms ([`SeedRule::ByNorms`], the decoder's `construct_by_norms`), where it can.
